	Hello my name is Lucas Zalesny and I'am a 12th grader at Everest Public High School. I have a girlfriend and her name is Grace. She is very important to me. I care about her a lot.  
	My favorite movie is Spirted Away and my favorite food is Ramen.
	I like the movie Spirted Away becasue its has a really deep menaing behind it and I love how the animation is done. 
	I like ramen becasue the flavoring of it is really good, the people who make it put their time and effort in it. 
	My hobby is playing video games becasue I like to see the graphics and the story. 
	I like video games becasue it brings many peoples imagination to life that probably might happen in the future.
