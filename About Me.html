	Hello my name is Lucas Zalesny and I'am a 12th grader at Everest Public High School. 
	My favorite movie is Godzilla and my favorite food is Ramen.
	I like the movie Godzilla becasue its cool to know the science behind it and to see if its possiable to create one. 
	I like ramen becasue the flavoring of it is really good, the people who make it put their time and effort in it. 
	My hobby is playing video games becasue I like to see the graphics and the story. 
	I like video games becasue it brings many peoples imagination to life that probably might happen in the future.
	Many people are designing new ways to interact with video games.
