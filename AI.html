This code makes my bot that I created move and take items. The first part of my code is the var enemyBots. This piece of code assigns the names to the bots that are on the map. If you are one of these bots you will be pushed at that bot name. The second part of code is the notmyMines. The mines are also given names just like the bots. When a bot takes a mine it is given the name of that mine as bot1mines or bot3mines. The next lines of code are my decsicon tree. My bot is able to go to taverns and drink and drink again. He can also go to free mines and take mines and also take taken mines that have been taken by enemyBots. The code that states closetmine or closettavern. When it is on the map the postion of my bot will find the closet mine or closet tavern.

In 1955 John McCarthy created the term AI. AI has grown into something really amazing. we have robots helping the sick and edlerly people. They kind of think like humans but they are not at the point of thinking just like humans. It would be really amazing if we could get AI's to learn just like humans can. We would be able to work with them and do more then we can like they could go to places that humans cant go and give us data about that place.
